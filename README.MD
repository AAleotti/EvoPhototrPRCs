### The Molecular Evolution of Animal Phototransduction and Photoreceptor Cells.
#

#### This repository contains material associated to the metacell analysis described in the research article "The Molecular Evolution of Animal Phototransduction and Photoreceptor Cells" by Alessandra Aleotti, Flaviano Giorgini, and Roberto Feuda.
#

##### Analyses are based on the MetaCell tutorial: https://tanaylab.github.io/metacell/articles/d-amphimedon.html
##### Scripts, inputs and outputs are provided for all species analysed.
##### Note that where files are very large, they are provided in compressed format.
